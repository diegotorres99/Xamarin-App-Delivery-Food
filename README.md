Food Delivery App
A robust and user-friendly food delivery application built with a focus on real-time data, efficient design, and a responsive interface.

Enhanced UI Components:
Triggers, Behaviors, and Converters: Adds custom interactions to improve user engagement and real-time feedback.
Reusable Styles and Themes: Provides a cohesive, visually appealing experience across the app.
Visual Status Manager: Manages order statuses visually, so users can easily track order progress, from preparation to delivery.
Collection Views: Organizes restaurant menus, categories, and items with grouped views, headers, and footers for a structured browsing experience.
Custom Font Icons: Uses fonts as images to enhance visual appeal without impacting app performance.
Media Integration: Uses MediaElement and PanCake plugins for in-app multimedia support, such as food previews and promotional videos.
Payment Gateway Integration: Secures and simplifies transactions with integrated payment options, providing a trustworthy and smooth checkout experience.
This project showcases a complete food delivery solution, combining real-time data, offline functionality, and an intuitive interface, perfect for developers interested in high-performance mobile applications with modern architectural patterns.
